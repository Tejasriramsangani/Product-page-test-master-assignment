Hello viewer,
I am completing this assignment

setup:

Before you begin developing, create a branch from master and name it `firstName_lastNameInitial`, e.g. `git checkout -b james_g` and publish the branch to the remote repo.
- Configure the application by running `composer install && npm install`
- To run the application you need a minimum of php7.3 to serve the application. Once php is installed you may run `php artisan serve`
- Open a second terminal and run `npm run watch`
- By default you should be able to go to http://localhost:8000 in your browser and the application will be ready to use.
